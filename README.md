# Carson System

The *Carson* star system is a large yellow dwarf star about halfway through its life cycle. It is 2.4 light-years away from the Sun, which our home planet *Timber Hearth* orbits. Due to its low mass, Hornfels has theorized that *Carson* won't supernova at the end of its life cycle. It is powered through the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium. This means that instead, once it runs out of hydrogen, it'll begin to fuse the helium into heavier elements and the star will expand into a red giant, before eventually shrinking down into a white dwarf.

*Carson* is currently home to 2 planets and 1 moon.

## Urath
*Urath* is a green, Hearth-like planet, but unlike *Timber Hearth*, it has a beautiful blue ocean around its continents. It fathers a small tidally-locked moon that's been dubbed as *Loon*. How quaint...

### Loon
*Loon* is a cute little rock hurling around *Urath*. Full of craters and rocky riverbeds. It almost reminds me of the *Attlerock* back at home...

## Platinum Hue
*Platinum Hue* is a big gas giant. It has a pearlescent appearance, with the clouds containing mesmerizing pastel swirls in a beautiful sea of ivory. Nobody knows as of yet what lies beyond that enticing atmosphere...
